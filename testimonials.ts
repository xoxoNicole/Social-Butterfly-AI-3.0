    quote: "Social Butterfly AI has quickly become an invaluable asset in my daily life. She is, without question, my favorite and absolute go-to GPT. Since incorporating her into my workflow, my productivity has increased in ways I did not think possible.\n\nI rely on her for everyday research that is far more efficient, targeted, and insightful than a standard Google search. Whether I am exploring a new idea, gathering background information, or diving deep into a complex topic, she consistently delivers clarity and direction.\n\nSocial Butterfly also helps me ideate, prepare drafts, and edit my work while still preserving the authenticity of my creative voice.\n\nQuite literally, I see Social Butterfly as an invaluable thought partner. She makes my work easier, my ideas sharper, and my creative process and content creation enjoyable.",

    quote: "I honestly don’t know where to start – Social Butterfly has made my everyday life so much easier.\n\nI work with parents, autistic children and families who need simple visuals and communication images. Before, it took me hours. Now I share my thoughts, and Social Butterfly helps me turn them into posts, teaching plans, and picture cards quickly and beautifully.\n\nIt feels like I’m not working alone anymore – it’s me and Social Butterfly as a team.\n\nIf you want your ideas to move from your head into the world in a clear, organised and powerful way, I highly recommend Social Butterfly.",
